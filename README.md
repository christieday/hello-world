My general repository.

Hello I'm Christie Day, a Los Angeles based Product Designer with focus on user experience and interaction design. I help build thoughtful interactive experiences for digital brands. I believe great product design comes from empathy and holism.

I was most recently working as the Director of Product Design at WAV Media where I successfully lead the redesign of the core app including research, strategy, user experience and design from conception to execution into mass market within 6 months. I managed designers across the marketing, product design and motion graphics teams as well as closely collaborating with international development teams.
